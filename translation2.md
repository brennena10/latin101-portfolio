C. Translation

Long ago Prometheus, Iapeteus' first son, was made from mud. 
At the same time, Vulcan made a woman from mud. 
Minerva gave this woman a soul, and all the God’s gave her gifts. 
On account of this, the name “Pandora” was given to her. 
Pandora was given in marriage to Epimetheus by Jove. 
Their daughter was Phyrra, the first mortal.
