After being unable to capture Troy for a period of ten years, Achilles and Epeus made a wooden horse of great size. 
In this, there was a collection for Menelaus, Ulixēs, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus.
And in the horse they wrote "A gift to the Greeks from Minerva", and carried it to the military base of Tenedo.
With seeing this, and the Trojans having judged the enemy to have gone away, Priam ordered the horse to be lead to the temple of Minerva.
With the prophet, Cassandra, said that the horse holds the enemy, but they did not trust her and brought the horse to the temple as an offering.
Achilles exited the door of the horse and killed the guards in order to capture Troy.
